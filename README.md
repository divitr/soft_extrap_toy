# High Momentum Collision Analysis
### Worked on in the lab of Dr. Daniel Whiteson at UC Irvine

Often in High-Energy Physics, large amounts of data are available for collisions with low transverse momentum (p<sub>T</sub>), but not for those with high p<sub>T</sub>. As a result, it is difficult to analyze data from collisions with high p<sub>T</sub> because there is not enough data to train a machine learning model effectively. This project tests the ability of neural networks to extrapolate to high p<sub>T</sub> data, having been trained on low p<sub>T</sub> data.
